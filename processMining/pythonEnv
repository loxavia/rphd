o configure reticulate to point to the Python executable in your virtualenv, create a file in your project directory called .Rprofile with the following contents:

Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = ".venv/bin/python")
environment location: C:\Users\du\AppData\Local\R-MINI~1\envs\r-reticulate
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = ".venv/bin/python")

reticulate::py_config()
